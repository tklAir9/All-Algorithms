			int key = B[i]; //Remember the current value we are observing
			int j = i - 1; //Move one index back as we will be evaluating whether the value before key is larger
			while (j >= 0 && B[j] > key) { //short circuit if we are out of index of array (-1)
				B[j + 1] = B[j]; // shift the value that is greater than key by one to the right
				j--; //Move the index value one back and repeat while loop
			}
			B[j + 1] = key; // Since whatever was shifted right last has a duplicate in the array and the key value is missng, remove the left dublicated value with key
